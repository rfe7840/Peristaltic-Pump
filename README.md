# Peristaltic-Pump
## Description / Used Hardware
Aim of the project is a DIY version of a peristaltic Pump. Control of mass flow is done with a rotary Potentiometer and an ESP32. The used motor to drive the pump is a 28byj-48 5V Motor with an Uln2003 Driver board. For compression of the hose three grooved ball bearings ( innerdiameter = 8 mm, outerdiameter = 22mm, height/thickness = 7mm) ) are used.

## 3D-printed Parts

* Casing with place for pump 
* 3D Model of 28byj-48 5V Motor (just used for design)
* Moving parts mounted on the motor-axis (holding bearings)

## TODO

* print parts 
* write control-code
* testing and adaption
